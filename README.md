# Quant-Finance

This is my assignment for the Quantitative Finance course at Polimi Graduate School of Management. The topics involved were asset management, options pricing, and risk management.

I made use of mean variance criterion to rank and assess several stocks. 
Along with that, we had to study binomial models for options pricing to measure the future and present values of the derivative contracts to hedge against the risk. 
Besides this, we had to employ several risk management strategies, including VaR and EWMA, to understand the risks that arose in investing certain stocks.
